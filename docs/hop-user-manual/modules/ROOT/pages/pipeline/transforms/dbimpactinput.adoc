== Description

The Database Impact Input transform allows gives you the impact of a pipeline on a database.
It explains which transforms read, write, update or delete information, in which table, the SQL used, and so on.

IMPORTANT: This transform supports error handling.  You can add an error handling hop to a transform to be informed of the pipelines that throw an error when calculating the database impact. See also: xref:pipeline/errorhandling.adoc[Pipeline error handling].
